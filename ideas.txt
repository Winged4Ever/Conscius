    IDEAS:

    -How an editor might work:
    Simple map creator build in which you may select desired space on the map ->
    You will be asked to choose the type of an object which you want to place->
    If there is no desired archetype in the database, you will be asked to create one ->
    If you say yes, object creator will be executed ->
    You will be asked to choose the material type ->
    If there is no desired archetype in the database, you will be asked to create one ->
    e.t.c. e.t.c.

    -QTE's

    -When something would make you unconscious, you start to experience some
    events not making any sense to you, which would look like an e.g. jumping
    through the plot or maybe your somehow altered memories (e.g. 3 virtual days
    ago you've hunted a dragon and this time the game would make you experience
    it but in an altered way, e.g. you may be a frog ^^) in which you may, if
    you can, interact. Then you would wake up and figure it out that this was
    just a dream. Or maybe it wasn't just a dream ;]

    -When avatar is not concentrated enough on ones senses, info about them
    would be interlaced with blank characters (with some kind of viscosity
    mechanism) or with strange symbols

    -When avatar is more skilled on concentrating and/or meditation things, ones
    can concentrate fully on more than one sense, with even better results

    -After logging in, avatar is inattentive, and requires 'waking' him up.
    Meanwhile, time is not running, only random thoughts are being displayed

    -Ones can focus on chosen sense by typing corresponding character of given
    sense eg. '@' for hearing

    -Make a tutorial about the interface and the very basic stuff

    -Senses can be dormant, ones can be more awake or more latent of choice,
    depending of concentration skill

    -Reaction mechanism, when some actions arouses reflex sense, reflex time bar
    would show up, and depending on out concentration skill, it would expire
    faster or slower, giving the player particular amount of time to react

    -when ones would like to go AFK, first he would need to find a calm place,
    in order to daydream to enable AFK/exit option. Only when game is turned of
    when daydreaming, the progress would save. And depending on avatars
    concentration skill, ones can daydream on various places, in various
    situations, in various rate. If the avatar has been "unplugged" while not
    daydreaming, after the next game load, one will wake up in a strange place,
    with strong headache, just as he would have rapidly woken up from beta brain
    state in which one had very vivid visions. The seemed unsaved progress won't
    be lost, it will be used lated in subconscious phases or in nagual mode.

    -Mental disease e.g. Synesthesia

    -Actions will have their sense-arousing structure, which would convey how
    our senses can receive them

    -Upper part of the terminal is designated for senses, the lower one - for
    memory storage and commanding

    -The longer avatar focuses on one (more or less)chosen sense, the more
    stable it becomes, but for a price or others senses stability. When ones
    concentrate too short period of time on selected sense, after switching to
    another one, it will become partially unintelligible in a shorter period of
    time. On a higher level of concentration ones can switch or remain focused
    on even every sense or have clear mind for a longer time, with faster rate
    of alternation

    -Character of people would be based on Eneagram mechanism

    -Epistemology based knowledge mechanism
